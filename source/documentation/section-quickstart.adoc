== Quickstart

Pivio has a demo setup to get you started quickly.

Requirements:

You need Java 8 and Docker installed.

Run the following command in your shell:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivio/pivio-boot/master/pivio-boot.sh | /bin/sh
```

This will fetch all Sources, builds it, starts the server and imports some demo data.

After that you can open your browser on port 8080 to see Pivio in Action.
